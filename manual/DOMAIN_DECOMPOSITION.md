The following table describes the [keywords and options](parsing.md) that can be used with this action 

| Keyword | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:----:|:-------:|:-----------|
| NATOMS | compulsory | none | the number of atoms across all the domains |
| PBCLABEL | compulsory | Box |  the label to use for the PBC action that will be created |
| NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES | optional | false |  calculate the derivatives for these quantities numerically |
| VALUE | optional | not used | value to create for the domain decomposition |
