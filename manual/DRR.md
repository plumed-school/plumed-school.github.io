|:--------|:--------:|
| Used to performed extended-system adaptive biasing force(eABF) | ![used in 0 tutorials](https://img.shields.io/badge/tutorials-0-red.svg)[![used in 6 eggs](https://img.shields.io/badge/nest-6-green.svg)](https://www.plumed-nest.org/browse.html?search=DRR) | 

## Output components

This action calculates the [values](pecifying_arguments.html) in the following table.  These [values](pecifying_arguments.html) can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the [value](pecifying_arguments.html) required from the list below.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:-------|
| bias | scalar | the instantaneous value of the bias potential | 
| _fict | scalar | one or multiple instances of this quantity can be referenced elsewhere in the input file | 
| _vfict | scalar | one or multiple instances of this quantity can be referenced elsewhere in the input file | 
| _biasforce | scalar | The bias force from eABF/DRR of the fictitious particle | 
| _springforce | scalar | Spring force between real CVs and extended CVs | 
| _fictNoPBC | scalar | the positions of fictitious particles (without PBC) | 


## Input

The [arguments](specifying_arguments.html) that serve as the input for this action are specified using one or more of the keywords in the following table.
