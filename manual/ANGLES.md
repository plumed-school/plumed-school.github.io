## Output components

This action can calculate the quantities in the following table when the associated keyword is included in the input for the action. These quantities can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity required from the list below.

| Name | Type | Keyword | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| lessthan | scalar | LESS_THAN | the number of colvars that have a value less than a threshold | 
| morethan | scalar | MORE_THAN | the number of colvars that have a value more than a threshold | 
| altmin | scalar | ALT_MIN | the minimum value of the cv | 
| min | scalar | MIN | the minimum colvar | 
| max | scalar | MAX | the maximum colvar | 
| between | scalar | BETWEEN | the number of colvars that have a value that lies in a particular interval | 
| highest | scalar | HIGHEST | the largest of the colvars | 
| lowest | scalar | LOWEST | the smallest of the colvars | 
| sum | scalar | SUM | the sum of the colvars | 
| mean | scalar | MEAN | the mean of the colvars | 


## Input

The input for this action is specified using one or more of the keywords in the following table.

| Keyword |  Type | Description |
|:--------|:------:|:-----------|
| GROUP | atoms | Calculate angles for each distinct set of three atoms in the group |
| GROUPA | atoms | A group of central atoms about which angles should be calculated |
| GROUPB | atoms | When used in conjunction with GROUPA this keyword instructs plumed to calculate all distinct angles involving one atom from GROUPA and two atoms from GROUPB |
| GROUPC | atoms | This must be used in conjunction with GROUPA and GROUPB |

## Syntax 
The following table describes the keywords and options that can be used with this action 

| Keyword | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:----:|:-------:|:-----------|
| GROUP | input | none | Calculate angles for each distinct set of three atoms in the group |
| GROUPA | input | none | A group of central atoms about which angles should be calculated |
| GROUPB | input | none | When used in conjunction with GROUPA this keyword instructs plumed to calculate all distinct angles involving one atom from GROUPA and two atoms from GROUPB |
| GROUPC | input | none | This must be used in conjunction with GROUPA and GROUPB |
| SWITCH | optional | not used | the switching function specifies that only those bonds that have a length that is less than a certain threshold are considered |
| LESS_THAN | optional | not used | calculate the number of variables that are less than a certain target value |
| MORE_THAN | optional | not used | calculate the number of variables that are more than a certain target value |
| ALT_MIN | optional | not used | calculate the minimum value |
| MIN | optional | not used | calculate the minimum value |
| MAX | optional | not used | calculate the maximum value |
| BETWEEN | optional | not used | calculate the number of values that are within a certain range |
| HIGHEST | optional | false |  this flag allows you to recover the highest of these variables |
| HISTOGRAM | optional | not used | calculate a discretized histogram of the distribution of values |
| LOWEST | optional | false |  this flag allows you to recover the lowest of these variables |
| SUM | optional | false |  calculate the sum of all the quantities |
| MEAN | optional | false |  calculate the mean of all the quantities |
