## Output components

This action can calculate the [values](pecifying_arguments.html) in the following table when the associated keyword is included in the input for the action. These [values](pecifying_arguments.html) can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the [value](pecifying_arguments.html) required from the list below.

| Name | Type | Keyword | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| lessthan | scalar | LESS_THAN | the number of colvars that have a value less than a threshold | 
| morethan | scalar | MORE_THAN | the number of colvars that have a value more than a threshold | 
| between | scalar | BETWEEN | the number of colvars that have a value that lies in a particular interval | 
| sum | scalar | SUM | the sum of the colvars | 
| mean | scalar | MEAN | the mean of the colvars | 


## Input

The [atoms](specifying_atoms.html) that serve as the input for this action are specified using one or more of the keywords in the following table.

| Keyword |  Type | Description |
|:--------|:------:|:-----------|
| CATOMS | atoms | all the angles between the bonds that radiate out from these central atom are computed |
| GROUP | atoms | a list of angls between pairs of bonds connecting one of the atoms specified using the CATOM command and two of the atoms specified here are computed |

## Syntax 
The following table describes the [keywords and options](parsing.md) that can be used with this action 

| Keyword | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:----:|:-------:|:-----------|
| CATOMS | input | none | all the angles between the bonds that radiate out from these central atom are computed |
| GROUP | input | none | a list of angls between pairs of bonds connecting one of the atoms specified using the CATOM command and two of the atoms specified here are computed |
| SWITCH | compulsory | none | the switching function specifies that only those bonds that have a length that is less than a certain threshold are considered |
| LESS_THAN | optional | not used | calculate the number of variables that are less than a certain target value |
| MORE_THAN | optional | not used | calculate the number of variables that are more than a certain target value |
| BETWEEN | optional | not used | calculate the number of values that are within a certain range |
| HISTOGRAM | optional | not used | calculate a discretized histogram of the distribution of values |
| SUM | optional | false |  calculate the sum of all the quantities |
| MEAN | optional | false |  calculate the mean of all the quantities |
