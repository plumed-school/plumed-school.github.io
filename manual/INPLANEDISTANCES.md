# [Shortcut](shortcuts.md): INPLANEDISTANCES

| Description    | Usage |
|:--------|:--------:|
| Calculate the distance between a pair of atoms in the plane | ![used in 0 tutorials](https://img.shields.io/badge/tutorials-0-red.svg)[![used in 1 eggs](https://img.shields.io/badge/nest-1-green.svg)](https://www.plumed-nest.org/browse.html?search=INPLANEDISTANCES)|
 | **output value** | **type** |
| the INPLANEDISTANCE between each of the atoms specified using the GROUP keyword and atom A in the plane perpendicular to the vector connecting the atoms specified using VECTORSTART and VECTOREND | vector |

## Output components

This action can calculate the [values](pecifying_arguments.html) in the following table when the associated keyword is included in the input for the action. These [values](pecifying_arguments.html) can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the [value](pecifying_arguments.html) required from the list below.

| Name | Type | Keyword | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| lessthan | scalar | LESS_THAN | the number of colvars that have a value less than a threshold | 
| morethan | scalar | MORE_THAN | the number of colvars that have a value more than a threshold | 
| altmin | scalar | ALT_MIN | the minimum value of the cv | 
| min | scalar | MIN | the minimum colvar | 
| max | scalar | MAX | the maximum colvar | 
| between | scalar | BETWEEN | the number of colvars that have a value that lies in a particular interval | 
| highest | scalar | HIGHEST | the largest of the colvars | 
| lowest | scalar | LOWEST | the smallest of the colvars | 
| sum | scalar | SUM | the sum of the colvars | 
| mean | scalar | MEAN | the mean of the colvars | 


## Input

The [atoms](specifying_atoms.html) that serve as the input for this action are specified using one or more of the keywords in the following table.

| Keyword |  Type | Description |
|:--------|:------:|:-----------|
| GROUP | atoms | calculate distance for each distinct set of three atoms in the group |
| VECTORSTART | atoms | The first atom position that is used to define the normal to the plane of interest |
| VECTOREND | atoms | The second atom position that is used to defin the normal to the plane of interest |

## Syntax 
The following table describes the [keywords and options](parsing.md) that can be used with this action 

| Keyword | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:----:|:-------:|:-----------|
| GROUP | input | none | calculate distance for each distinct set of three atoms in the group |
| VECTORSTART | input | none | The first atom position that is used to define the normal to the plane of interest |
| VECTOREND | input | none | The second atom position that is used to defin the normal to the plane of interest |
| LESS_THAN | optional | not used | calculate the number of variables that are less than a certain target value |
| MORE_THAN | optional | not used | calculate the number of variables that are more than a certain target value |
| ALT_MIN | optional | not used | calculate the minimum value |
| MIN | optional | not used | calculate the minimum value |
| MAX | optional | not used | calculate the maximum value |
| BETWEEN | optional | not used | calculate the number of values that are within a certain range |
| HIGHEST | optional | false |  this flag allows you to recover the highest of these variables |
| HISTOGRAM | optional | not used | calculate a discretized histogram of the distribution of values |
| LOWEST | optional | false |  this flag allows you to recover the lowest of these variables |
| SUM | optional | false |  calculate the sum of all the quantities |
