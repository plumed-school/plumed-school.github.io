## Output components

This action calculates the [values](pecifying_arguments.html) in the following table.  These [values](pecifying_arguments.html) can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the [value](pecifying_arguments.html) required from the list below.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:-------|
| lp | scalar | the position along the funnel line | 
| ld | scalar | the distance from the funnel line | 


## Input

The [atoms](specifying_atoms.html) that serve as the input for this action are specified using one or more of the keywords in the following table.

| Keyword |  Type | Description |
|:--------|:------:|:-----------|
| LIGAND | atoms | This MUST be a single atom, normally the COM of the ligand |
| ANCHOR | atoms | Closest protein atom to the ligand, picked to avoid pbc problems during the simulation |
