## Output components

This action can calculate the [values](pecifying_arguments.html) in the following table when the associated keyword is included in the input for the action. These [values](pecifying_arguments.html) can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the [value](pecifying_arguments.html) required from the list below.

| Name | Type | Keyword | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| lessthan | scalar | LESS_THAN | the number of colvars that have a value less than a threshold | 
| morethan | scalar | MORE_THAN | the number of colvars that have a value more than a threshold | 
| altmin | scalar | ALT_MIN | the minimum value of the cv | 
| min | scalar | MIN | the minimum colvar | 
| max | scalar | MAX | the maximum colvar | 
| between | scalar | BETWEEN | the number of colvars that have a value that lies in a particular interval | 
| highest | scalar | HIGHEST | the largest of the colvars | 
| lowest | scalar | LOWEST | the smallest of the colvars | 
| sum | scalar | SUM | the sum of the colvars | 
| mean | scalar | MEAN | the mean of the colvars | 


## Input

The [atoms](specifying_atoms.html) that serve as the input for this action are specified using one or more of the keywords in the following table.

| Keyword |  Type | Description |
|:--------|:------:|:-----------|
| SPECIES | atoms | this keyword is used for colvars such as coordination number |
| SPECIESA | atoms | this keyword is used for colvars such as the coordination number |
| SPECIESB | atoms | this keyword is used for colvars such as the coordination number |

## Syntax 
The following table describes the [keywords and options](parsing.md) that can be used with this action
