## Output components

This action can calculate the quantities in the following table when the associated keyword is included in the input for the action. These quantities can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity required from the list below.

| Name | Type | Keyword | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| lessthan | scalar | LESS_THAN | the number of colvars that have a value less than a threshold | 
| morethan | scalar | MORE_THAN | the number of colvars that have a value more than a threshold | 
| altmin | scalar | ALT_MIN | the minimum value of the cv | 
| min | scalar | MIN | the minimum colvar | 
| max | scalar | MAX | the maximum colvar | 
| between | scalar | BETWEEN | the number of colvars that have a value that lies in a particular interval | 
| highest | scalar | HIGHEST | the largest of the colvars | 
| lowest | scalar | LOWEST | the smallest of the colvars | 
| sum | scalar | SUM | the sum of the colvars | 
| mean | scalar | MEAN | the mean of the colvars |
